        <h1>Arizona</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in Arizona is where I spend most of my days, chilling outside and relaxing all smooth and during the summer time trying to stay cool.
           Funny thing about Arizona is most of the people out here aren't from here. Outside of the extreme heat (during the summer)
           Arizona is a nice place to live. I seldomly travel outside of Arizona but I've been to Mexico and San Diego in which those 
           2 are like Arizona's hotter/sexier cousin's because they have beaches; and yes I did personafy the mentioned locations. 
           Arizona is continuing to grow because of it's price of living and ever growing potential. Needless to say Happy I was born and raised an Arizonan.

    <h1>What I do in a day</h1>
        <p>I've been working for Amazon for 7 years; that's where I occupy most of my time working as a Tom Team Associate where I drive day cabs and hostlers, transportating trailers. 
            Working for Amazon has given me many opportunites over the years. 
            They have great benefits and I've been able to aquire my Commercial Driver License (CDL) through their career choice program.
            When I'm not at work I'm working out and training in combat sports. I currently have a record of 3-1. I strive to continue to get better at MMA
            by spending more time on the subject and learning as much as I can during training.
