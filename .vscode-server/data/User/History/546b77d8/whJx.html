        <h1>Arizona</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in Arizona is where I spent most of my days, chilling outside and relaxing all smooth and during the summer time trying to stay cool.
           Funny thing about Arizona is most of the people out here aren't from here. Outside of the extreme heat (during the summer)
           Arizona is a nice place to live almost year around. I seldomly travel outside of Arizona but I've been to Mexico and San Diego in which those 
           2 are like Arizona's hotter/sexier cousin's because they have beaches; and yes I did personify the mentioned locations. 
           Arizona is continuing to grow because of it's cheap cost of living and ever growing potential. Take a brief tour of Arizona below.

    <h1>What I do in a day</h1>
        <p>I've been working for Amazon for 7 years; that's where I occupy most of my 
        time working as a Tom Team Associate where I drive day cabs and hostlers, transportating trailers. 
            Working for Amazon has given me many<br> (click the amazon logo to learn more) opportunites over the years. 
            They have great benefits and I've been able to aquire my Commercial Driver 
            License (CDL) through their career choice program.
            When I'm not at work I'm working out and training in combat sports. 
            I currently have a record of 3-1 in combat sports. I strive to continue to get better at MMA
            by spending more time on the subject and learning as much as I can during training. I also trade stocks and cryptos and in 2021 I made over $165k trading the markets!

        <h1>Pursuing Life Changing Goals</h1>
        <p>What or who we occupy our time with must have a means to an end, rather it be marriage, job promotions,
            financial wealth or other. We can't let what we spend our time on bring no meaning or purpose to our lives.
            My goal is to become a Software developer, a very difficult but obtainable goal.
            It would mean alot to me being labled a Software engineer. This is my goal I must pursue and a healthy
            obsession must be created in order for me to manifest my desired results in this field. I Also plan on making double or more money in the stock market and crypto once I do my research.
            It's been a while but all it takes is focus and effort!
