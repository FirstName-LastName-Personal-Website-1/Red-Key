        <h2>Project Applehead</h2>
       <p class="apple">Apple head is a larger than life chihuahua that is small and so terrified 
        of his surroundings that ordinary things become monstrous obstacles to him for example your everyday 
        singing tree bird appears as a hawk to him, a remote control car seems like a monstertruck to him
        a basketball becomes a giant boulder to him. It creates an adventure like realm for our small easily frighten dog.<br>
        Apple head is a brave dog who gets his courage from barking, eating table food (like spaghetti) and from the help of his friends from nature like dougley 
        the tortoise and spaz the cat.<br> Sit down with friends and family and watch the upcoming 'Apple Head' animated series coming out 
        2024.

        you're taking, when youre jumping or doing pull-ups or even when you're lifting weights.
