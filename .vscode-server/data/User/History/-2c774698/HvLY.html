        <h2>Project Applehead</h2>
       <p class="apple">Apple head is a larger than life chihuahua that is small and so terrified 
        of his surroundings<br> Ordinary things seem like terrifying objects to him for example<br> your everyday 
        singing tree bird appears as a hawk to him, a remote control car seems like a monstertruck to him<br>
        a basketball becomes a boulder to him. It creates an adventure like realm for our small easily frighten dog.<br>
        Apple head is a brave dog who gets his courage from barking and from the help of his friends from nature like frank 
        the tortoise.<br> Sit down with friends and family and watch the upcoming 'Apple Head' animated series coming out 
        2024.
